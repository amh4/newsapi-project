# News challenge

## Project overview

This app takes the Guardian Newspaper API and populates the page with the 10 most recent articles. This is done using a JS fetch request and processing the subsequent promise.

Additionally you are able to search all headlines for a specific term and the page will populate the results that relate.

### Technologies

This uses a combination of Javascript, HTML and CSS. Utilising the Jest testing library for TDD.

### Next steps

Given the time constraints of building this over a weekend I was unable to perform TDD to the standard that I would have liked. I need to implement testing for the ArticlesView class. As I was running short on time I was able to TDD the Model and Client class but not the View.

I would like to integrate more search terms for the user and the ability to view a summary of the article.
